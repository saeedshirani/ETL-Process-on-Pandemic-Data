# COVID-19 Data ETL Project
This project aims to establish a robust Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process for handling COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). As the volume of COVID-19 data continues to expand over time, traditional spreadsheet platforms become unsuitable for managing and analyzing such data. Thus, the decision was made to create a dedicated database for COVID-19 data management.
This dataset exclusively comprises data pertaining to countries with populations exceeding 10 million.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient ETL pipeline that extracts COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data website, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a database. By establishing this pipeline, we aim to facilitate easier data access, analysis, and visualization for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

## Documentation

Extensive documentation detailing the ETL process and project overview is available [here](https://github.com/saeedshiranii/ETL-Process-on-Pandemic-Data/blob/main/COVID-19%20Data%20ETL%20Project%20Documentation.pdf). This document provides a comprehensive understanding of the project's goals, methodologies, and technical implementations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

The data extraction process begins with downloading a CSV file from the Our World in Data website, containing COVID-19 statistics such as deaths, cases, and vaccinations. Upon download, this single CSV file is split into two datasets. Subsequently, the data undergoes a series of transformations, including cleaning and formatting, to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility with the database schema.

## Getting Started
